The Fidelius Charm

Description:

A charm involving secret information hidden within the soul of a
Secret-Keeper. This information is irretrievable until the
Secret-Keeper chooses to reveal it; those who have the secret revealed
to them cannot reveal it to others.

Seen/mentioned:

In Prisoner of Azkaban, it is explained that when Harry was an infant,
he and his parents, James and Lily Potter, were hidden from Voldemort
by this charm. Later, in Order of the Phoenix, the charm is used to
hide the location of the headquarters for the Order of the Phoenix.
Order members in Deathly Hallows also use it to protect their homes.

Notes:

Rowling previously stated that when a Secret-Keeper dies, the Secret
they held can never be revealed to anyone else; the people who were
told before the Secret-Keeper's death will still know the secret, but
after the death of the Secret-Keeper no one new can be brought into the
circle of knowledge.[12] However, in Deathly Hallows, it is explained
that upon the Keeper's death, all those who have been told the secret
become Secret-Keepers in turn, and can pass the secret on to others.
